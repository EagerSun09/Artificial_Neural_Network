I test this program(main.py) in pycharm.
To run the program(main.py), make sure it's in the same folder with ANN - Iris data.txt.

When running the program, first you will be asked to tune parameters just follow the instruction.

Parameters:
	BIAS: The bias in ANN
	LEARNING_RATE: The learning rate in ANN
	VISIBLE: If you input 'n', the training steps won't be shown; if you input 'y', training steps will be showed.

Topology and Rules of My ANN:

There are three layers: input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Since we have 4 attributes, I simply set the size of input layer as 4. For the size of hidden layer, I tried from 1 to 9 and found 8 works best. The size of output layer would be equal to the number of label which is 3.

Since the weights between neurons and bias, neurons and neurons are randomly generated, the overall accuracy may change when restart the ANN.

Like the activation function talked in lecture, I used sigmoid function in ANN. Besides, I de-correlate data attributes via a value normalization method: Variance.

The bias and learning rate could be changed, but during my test, the best value for bias is 1 and best learning rate is 0.1.

Since, I think the data set we have is not too large, I use 60% of them as the training data, 20% as validation data, and 20% as testing data.

The max iteration is set to 1000 and the min acceptable MSE is set to 0.001. One of the condition is satisfied, the training step will end.
